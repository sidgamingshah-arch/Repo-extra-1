# Frontend (React 18 + TypeScript, Vite)

Implemented in `frontend/`, from the FinExtract design handoff. Run with
`cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev` alongside the backend; the Vite dev server
proxies `/api` to FastAPI. See `frontend/README.md` for the file map.

## Stack — what is actually installed

`frontend/package.json` declares **five** runtime dependencies and nothing else:

| Dependency | Used for |
|---|---|
| `react` 18 | the app |
| `react-dom` 18 | rendering it |
| `react-router-dom` 6 | routing (`src/App.tsx`) |
| `@tanstack/react-query` 5 | all durable server data (`src/lib/queries.ts`) |
| `zustand` 4 | the ephemeral UI store (`src/store.ts`) |

Dev-only: `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript`, `@playwright/test`, and the React
type packages.

Everything else is hand-rolled, deliberately, and the file that owns it is the thing to
name when it needs changing:

- **The grid** — plain flex/grid rows built by `src/screens/Workspace.tsx` from the
  statement payload (`sections → items → subtotals/totals`, a note column, and one column
  per period), with `src/components/ui.tsx` supplying the shared primitives (`Card`,
  `ScreenHeader`, `Pill`, `ConfidencePill`/`confReadout`, `NoteChip`, `Button`, `Segmented`,
  `FieldChip`, `Toggle`, `StatusIcon`).
- **The source viewer** — `src/components/SourceViewer.tsx`. PDF pages are **rasterized
  server-side** (`GET /documents/{id}/pages/{n}/image`, PyMuPDF) and rendered as `<img>`
  in a lazily-loading page stack; the highlight is a percent-positioned box over the page
  holder. Spreadsheet sources render a cell-context mini-grid instead.
- **i18n** — `src/i18n.ts` (core: shell, workspace, common terms) merging the per-screen
  dictionaries in `src/i18n/screens/*.ts`, exposed as `useT()`. `RTL_LOCALES` and
  `NATIVE_NAME` live there too.
- **Design tokens** — `src/theme.ts` (`color`, `font`, `radius`, `shadow`, `layout`,
  `confStyle`, plus the number helpers `fmtIN` / `fmtPlain` / `parseAccounting`). Components
  style inline from those constants; there is no CSS framework and no component library.
- **API types** — `src/types.ts`, hand-written TypeScript mirroring the backend payloads.
  There is no runtime schema validation at the boundary.
- **Excel** — written **server-side** by `backend/app/services/export.py` (openpyxl) and
  downloaded via `GET /documents/{id}/export?fmt=excel`. The client never builds a workbook.

### Libraries that were planned and not adopted

Earlier revisions of this document described **AG Grid, PDF.js, HyperFormula in a Web
Worker, ExcelJS, Tailwind, Radix, dnd-kit, React Hook Form, Zod and react-i18next** in the
present tense. **None of them is installed.** The design intent behind each is worth
keeping, so here is what replaced it:

| Intended | What ships instead |
|---|---|
| AG Grid (tree data, column groups, cell renderers) | hand-rolled rows in `Workspace.tsx`; sections/subtotals come from the template's own order, basis is a `Segmented` toggle rather than a column group |
| PDF.js (client-side viewport transform) | server-rasterized page PNGs + a percent-positioned overlay (`SourceViewer.tsx`) — no client PDF engine, no DPR/zoom maths |
| HyperFormula in a Web Worker | formulas are **strings evaluated server-side** by `backend/app/services/formula.py` (whitelisted AST); the client sends and displays the expression |
| ExcelJS | server-side openpyxl (`services/export.py`) |
| Tailwind + Radix | `src/theme.ts` tokens + `src/components/ui.tsx` primitives, inline styles |
| dnd-kit (template tree drag-and-drop) | the template is authored as an **Excel workbook** round-trip (`GET /templates/{id}/xlsx`, `POST /templates/xlsx`); the on-screen tree is read-only apart from per-node config |
| React Hook Form | plain controlled `useState` forms |
| Zod at the API boundary | hand-written types in `src/types.ts`; validation is the server's (422 responses are surfaced verbatim) |
| react-i18next | `src/i18n.ts` + `src/i18n/screens/*.ts` |

## State

- **TanStack Query** for durable server data — one hook per endpoint in `src/lib/queries.ts`.
- **Zustand** (`src/store.ts`) for the small ephemeral layer: output `locale`, the
  `uiLocalization` admin flag, the session `token`, `extractMode`, `activeDocumentId`,
  `dataset` (basis), `statement`, the selected row / note / expanded check, the selected
  template key and the export format. It is deliberately small — no zoom, no hover state,
  no dirty-edit buffer; edits go straight to the server and the query cache is invalidated.
- **React Router v6.** Routes are registered eagerly in `App.tsx`; there is no
  `React.lazy` code-splitting (there are no heavy PDF/grid bundles to split).

## Routes

`App.tsx` registers, all behind `RequireScreen` (which redirects a role away from a screen
`GET /me` says it cannot see):

```
/ → /workspace
/upload  ·  /integrity  ·  /scope  ·  /extraction  ·  /workspace  ·  /notes
/review  ·  /commentary  ·  /template  ·  /settings  ·  /export
/documents/:id → adopts :id as the active document, then redirects to /extraction
*              → /workspace
```

`src/screens/config.ts` is the single registry behind both the nav rail and the pipeline
stepper: `SCREENS` (11 entries), `NAV_GROUPS`, and `STEPPER` —
`Upload(1) → Integrity(2) → Scope(3) → **Extract(4) = /extraction** → Review(5) → Export(6)`.
Screens that are not themselves a step map to the step they sit at (`STEP_FOR_SCREEN`:
Workspace and All Notes sit at Extract, Analysis at Review), so the bar is never blank on
the screen an analyst spends most of their time on.

## Extraction screen (`/extraction`, `src/screens/ExtractionView.tsx`)

Step 4, and its own destination rather than something the Workspace happened to show. For a
caller who holds `pipeline:run` (analyst, admin) it starts — or adopts — the run for the
active document and **reports it while it is running**: a stage table built from the run's
own `stages` list, which stages are finished (`stages_done`), which one is in flight, pct,
elapsed time, and the tail of the pipeline log. Every figure is read from the served
`progress` record — a run the server has no progress for says *starting* rather than
printing a measured-looking 0%.

A caller without `pipeline:run` (a reviewer) would 403 on the POST, so the screen **reads**
the latest run instead, via `GET /documents/{id}/run`, and gets its rows, rulebook and
status. That endpoint serves no `progress` / `stages` / `log_tail`, and the progress panel is
rendered only on the run path, so the read-only reader sees no stage table — see
[07-rbac-and-commentary](07-rbac-and-commentary.md#role-based-access-control), where that gap
is called out.

**Progress is polled, not pushed.** `useExtraction` POSTs once per (document, ontology,
template) and then polls `GET /extractions/{run_id}` at 1s while `status === "running"`.
There is no WebSocket anywhere in the product.

Once the run succeeds the screen lists the real line items with per-value confidence and
click-to-source; the rulebook the run **recorded** is named above the rows (never a
client-side guess), and a re-extract control (gated on `pipeline:run`) starts a fresh run
against a revised template or a different rulebook.

## Signature screen — side-by-side hyperlinked viewer

Left: the source page stack (`PageStack`) or the spreadsheet cell grid (`ExcelGrid`).
Right: the template grid. Highlights are drawn from **normalized [0..1] bboxes** as
percent-positioned boxes inside the page holder, so they survive any display scale with no
recompute — the y-flip is normalized server-side so the client never touches it. Pages load
lazily as they near the viewport (and the picked page loads immediately, rather than waiting
for the scroll → IntersectionObserver chain), so a 200+ page filing does not fetch every
page at once.

Selection is one-way today: clicking a figure drives the viewer. There is no
`focusRequest`-style bidirectional channel in the store.

### Both periods are figures

Each period's value carries its own provenance, so **both** columns are click-to-source:
clicking last year's number drives the viewer to the page last year's number was printed
on. A reviewer checks the comparative as much as the current year, and linking only the
current column left half the grid dead.

## Signature screen — editable grid with formulas

Sections → items → subtotals in the template's declared order, with a note column and the
consolidated/standalone basis as a toggle. The inspector along the bottom edge describes
the selected figure — its origin, its arithmetic, each contribution's page, the comment —
resolved **for the period on show**, not for the row.

Formulas are strings: the inspector's formula box is sent to
`PATCH /documents/{id}/line-items/{key}` and evaluated by `services/formula.py`
server-side; the number in the cell is the value the server computed. Confidence is shown
as a colour-coded pill plus a readout that names the band when nothing measured a
percentage. Units/currency switching is a **display-time transform only** — the stored
source-unit numbers are untouched, and a currency change is refused outright when the FX
master has no rate for the pair (`useFxRateResolution`).

### Editing

The inspector edits either period, and sends only the columns actually retyped — so
correcting this year does not restate last year as a manual value and detach it from
the page. A save closes the editor **only when the server accepted it**; a refusal
shows the server's own reason (wrong basis, unknown concept, bad formula) and stays
open. Closing unconditionally was indistinguishable from success: the figure simply
never changed and nothing said why. Rows that are not correctable figures — a computed
KPI, a line mapped to no concept, an equity movement — carry `editable: false` and get
no control, rather than one that cannot work.

## The grid serves the template's lines, and only those

`_build_statement` (backend) emits **every declared section and line of the run's template,
in the template's order, and nothing else** — extracted or not, so a gap is visible and
fillable. Two consequences:

* There is **no "Other extracted items" heading.** It used to append any row whose
  canonical key carried the statement's prefix but was not one of the template's declared
  children, which added lines the template does not define — and against a run pinned to a
  superseded template it re-appended the very lines whose position a template revision had
  corrected. It is gone, front and back.
* A mapped figure still never vanishes in silence. A row mapped to a concept the run's
  template puts on no statement is raised as an **`off_template` review finding** carrying a
  re-map offer, so the queue both reports that the figure reaches no spread and offers the
  control that fixes it.

The **"Additional items"** Workspace view is likewise gone (`DERIVED_STATEMENTS` in
`src/types.ts` now lists `kpi` alone) — for the same reason: it was a second place that
rendered rows the template does not declare.

## Derived view: KPIs

The one Workspace view that is not a statement the document prints. Real-extraction only
(`DERIVED_STATEMENTS`), so the demo falls back to the balance sheet rather than asking for a
view the demo endpoint cannot serve. The ratio catalog is computed from this extraction,
current beside prior, grouped by category; every ratio lists the extracted figures it used,
each with its sign and its own page, so the arithmetic is checkable and an absent input is
visibly absent rather than silently zero. A ratio is not an amount: the response is
`presentation: "raw"`, rows carry pre-formatted `display1`/`display2` in their own unit
(×, %, days), and the currency/magnitude selectors are **absent rather than inert**. KPIs
are read-only — the fix for a wrong ratio is to fix the line items it came from.

## Review queue (`/review`, `src/screens/Review.tsx`)

Findings grouped by type, with tabs the **server** defines (each tab carries the check
types it selects, so the client never filters by list position): All · Checks · Unmapped ·
Low confidence · **Off template**. Each card expands into the reconciliation breakdown, the
suggested fix, and up to three controls:

* **Accept / withdraw a judgement** (`review:resolve`) — a named person, a timestamp and a
  required reason, pinned to the *figures* judged, so a re-run that moves them reopens the
  finding as `stale` rather than leaving a stale acceptance standing. A finding the server
  serves as `conflict` gets no accept path at all, and says why.
* **Flip sign** (`extraction:edit`) — the one mechanical fix, offered only when the server
  resolved exactly one row to flip. Every other card gets a sentence saying the fix is
  manual instead of a button that would do nothing.
* **Re-map** (`extraction:edit`) — `POST /documents/{id}/review/remap` with the row
  reference and the target canonical key, which is what **resolves** a row-shaped finding
  (unmapped / off-template / low-confidence). The candidate list is served once per payload
  as `remap_targets` (not per card); an empty target key un-maps the row, recording that it
  belongs to no template concept. The accounting findings carry no offer — a relation
  between several concepts gives no answer to which one to re-map.

## Template & ontology authoring (admin)

Two pages. **The index** (`src/screens/TemplateList.tsx`) lists the template versions and
carries the authoring desk: download a template as a workbook, upload the edited workbook
back as a new version, upload a rulebook (JSON) **against the template on screen** — which
is the one it is validated against, so a rule for a line the template does not define comes
back naming the key. The workbook's column contract is read from the endpoint that enforces
it (`GET /templates/xlsx/columns`), so the screen cannot describe columns the API would
reject. **The detail page** (`src/screens/Template.tsx`) is raised over the index and shows
one version's structure tree, per-node config, the netting policies and inline ontology
editing.

## Extraction mode — auto vs. confirm page scope

Chosen on the Upload screen (`extractMode` in the Zustand store, default **auto**).
In **auto** mode the pipeline detects statement pages and extracts in one pass: the
Integrity screen's forward action becomes **Extract now**, and the Page Scope step is
skipped. In **confirm** mode the Integrity action is **Detect statement pages** → the Page
Scope screen, where the user reviews/adjusts detected pages before extraction. The choice
is sent to the backend as `confirm_scope` on the extraction run and persisted in the run's
options.

## Other screens

Login (shown until a session exists) and the top-bar user menu; integrity report (routing
gate before review); notes tab (all published notes + note-ref chips linking face↔note);
Analysis (`Commentary.tsx`) as a printable one-pager; Settings (admin); export dialog with
a live preview.

## Riskiest UI parts

Bbox alignment across zoom/DPR — mitigated by normalized coords + percent positioning +
server-side y-flip, which is why there is no client-side viewport transform to get wrong.
Keeping raw/override/formula/computed coherent with the units transform — the `present()` /
`parseAccounting` path in `Workspace.tsx` is the one place a figure is scaled for display,
and a `presentation: "raw"` payload (the KPIs) opts out of it entirely. Progress delivery —
a 1s poll of the run endpoint while it is `running` (`lib/queries.ts`); a push channel
would additionally need a REST snapshot on reconnect, and is not built. Excel fidelity is
the server's problem rather than the client's, which is where it belongs.
