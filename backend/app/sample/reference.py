"""Keep the DB's reference template + ontology equal to the files this repo ships.

Loads the shipped HKFRS/IFRS template and its companion rulebook (app/sample/templates/) into the
versioned tables, publishing a new version whenever the file differs from the newest stored one —
idempotent, safe to call on every startup. This is what lets an uploaded document be mapped
against a real ontology out of the box.

REFRESHED ON EVERY BOOT, NOT SEEDED ONCE. This used to write a version 1 only when NO version of
the key existed, and then never look at the files again. So every edit made to
``hkfrs_hk_china_template.json`` and ``hkfrs_hk_china_ontology.json`` after a database's first
startup reached the test suite and no running app: ``tests/conftest.py`` points
``FINEX_DATABASE_URL`` at a fresh temp database, so pytest always seeds the CURRENT file and could
never see the drift, while the dev database went on serving whatever was seeded first.

What that cost, in the words of the person who reported it: "Gross Profit and the other calculated
totals still render at the END of the template". They did. The row builder emits the template's own
order faithfully (``services/statement_rows``); the template it was handed was the pre-revision
profit-and-loss, whose top-level order is the seven sections followed by every calculated total
bunched at the bottom — four revisions of the shipped file, the one-template/one-rulebook
consolidation, a tax bucket removal and 12 new concepts, none of which had ever reached the
product. A seeding function that looks like it keeps the app current and does not is the defect
class this file now exists to prevent.

Comparison is on CANONICAL CONTENT (a sorted, separator-stable JSON dump), not on any field-by-field
guess about what "changed": the drift above was spread across statement order, node ids, rollup
children, aliases, criteria and metadata at once, and a guess about which of those to compare is a
guess that eventually misses one. Identical content adds NOTHING — that is the property that lets
this run on every boot.

THE CONSEQUENCE, stated rather than discovered: an edit made through the ontology editor (or an
uploaded template workbook) ON A SHIPPED KEY is superseded by the file on the next restart, because
the file is what this function holds the database to. Edits meant to last belong in the repo's
files, or under a key of their own — an uploaded rulebook keeps its own ``ontology_key`` and is
never touched here.

ONE template, ONE rulebook. Two generations used to ship side by side — a thin v1 and the v2 that
adds the section layer (``section_defaults`` + ``inherits``), the residual framework and the
validation block — on the reasoning that a run made against v1 should go on resolving to v1. That
reasoning is retired: there is one rulebook, and every concept is authored once in one vocabulary
instead of twice in two. Authoring it twice was not a theoretical cost — a concept written in the
other file's shape was a real defect twice over, caught each time by an invariant test rather than
by review.

Nothing here assumes it is the only rulebook that will ever exist. An uploaded or generated one
takes its place through the same versioned tables, and ``services/ontology_select`` still reads
``metadata.supersedes`` to decide which of several is in force.

Every file is put through the checks ``POST /ontologies`` / ``POST /templates`` apply, BEFORE
anything is written. This path used to write whatever was on disk: a shipped file that no longer
loads would then sit in the database as a row the read path chokes on — a 500 on the ontology
editor, or an extraction that reports SUCCEEDED with its structural checks silently gone (see
``loader.unknown_keys``). A startup that fails with the offending path named is the cheaper
failure, and it can only be reached by a defect in the repo's own files.

# which declared it superseded the thin one. Every database older than that consolidation still
# holds them, and it holds them AHEAD of the shipped rulebook on both of the tests
# ``services/ontology_select`` applies: ``hkfrs_hk_china_v2`` declares a supersession (the shipped
# file declares none) and was seen first (the shipped key is not in such a database at all until
# this function publishes it). Left alone, a 173-concept rulebook with a tax sweep bucket and no
# "Direct costs" alias would stay in force over the 185-concept one this repo ships.

# An explicit list of keys THIS REPO shipped — never "any key the shipped set does not name", which
# would also retire a rulebook someone uploaded beside the shipped one and so reopen the hole
# incumbency was added to close (see ``ontology_select.select_for_template``).
#
# Deliberately NOT stamped onto the stored rows. ``schemas.ontology.OntologyMetadata`` declares no
# field for "I have been replaced", so a ``metadata.superseded_by`` written into a stored definition
# is a stray key: ``loader.unknown_keys`` reports it, ``POST /ontologies`` refuses that definition
# on re-upload, and the ontology model drops it on the next round-trip. A mark that evaporates is
# worse than no mark, and it would record one fact in two places that can then disagree.

# older deployment, say — is treated as the legacy rulebook whose name it took: reported replaced,
