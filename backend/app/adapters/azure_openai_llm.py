"""Azure OpenAI adapter — the default LLM provider (GPT-5 mini).

Azure speaks the same Chat Completions body as OpenAI, and two things about it are different enough
to be worth stating, because both are silent failures when got wrong:

* THE ADDRESS. OpenAI selects a model by name on one shared endpoint. Azure selects a *deployment*
  on your own resource, and the model name appears nowhere in the URL:
  ``{azure_endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment}/chat/completions?api-version=...``.
  A deployment is frequently not named after the model it serves, so it is configured separately and
  falls back to ``llm.model`` only because naming them the same is the common case.
* THE AUTH. Azure authenticates with an ``api-key`` header. Sent as a bearer token the request is
  refused with a 401 that says nothing about which of the two conventions was expected.

The GPT-5 family also renamed the output cap to ``max_completion_tokens`` and rejects a non-default
``temperature``. Rather than hard-code a model-name test that goes stale on the next release, the
request is adapted on the 400 that says so — the same shape as the base adapter's existing
``response_format`` retry, and self-correcting when Azure changes its mind again.

Everything here is configuration (``config.toml [llm]``, editable at run time from the Settings
screen and persisted). The API KEY is not: only the NAME of the environment variable holding it is
stored, so a credential cannot reach the database or a settings export.
