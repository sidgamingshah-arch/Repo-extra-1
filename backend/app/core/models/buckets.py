"""The eight analyst buckets a filing's source is segmented into, and what each one holds.

WHY A SEGMENTATION AND NOT A COPY. Each segment names the face rows, notes and pages that belong
to its bucket; it does not carry their figures. A figure stored twice is two places computing one
quantity, and here the copy would be the one an analyst reads — so the membership is persisted and
the API joins it to ``line_items`` at serve time. What is new information (which content belongs to
which bucket) is stored; what already exists (the numbers) is referenced.

EVERY FACE ROW LANDS IN EXACTLY ONE BUCKET. That is what makes the face side safe to sum, and
``unresolved_face_item_ids`` is what stops "everything is placed" from being achieved by sweeping
the difficult cases into Others unnoticed: rows in Others because the balance sheet's own totals
span sections are a different fact from rows in Others because nothing could place them, and only
the second is a coverage failure.

A NOTE, BY CONTRAST, IS FILED IN EVERY BUCKET THAT CITES IT. A borrowings note split across current
and non-current belongs to both sections, and an analyst reading either one needs the note in front
of them — a pointer to the other bucket is not the same thing. The cost is real and is stated rather
than avoided: a shared note's figures appear more than once across the store, so the notes side is
NOT safe to add up. ``shared_notes`` names, in each bucket holding it, every note that is also
filed elsewhere, and the buckets index serves a distinct-note count beside the per-bucket totals —
so anything that needs a filing-level total can subtract the overlap, and the duplication is
visible instead of silent.
