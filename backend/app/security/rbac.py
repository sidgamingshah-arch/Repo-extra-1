"""Role-based access control.

Three roles with a permission matrix. Configuration actions (editing the template,
uploading an ontology, changing page scope, changing export inclusions, managing
documents) are **admin-controlled**; the analyst gets a deliberately simple flow
(view/edit values, notes, commentary, export). Reviewers sit in between.

Identity comes from a **session token** (``Authorization: Bearer …``) issued by
``POST /auth/login`` — see ``session.py``. For local dev, tests, and service-to-service
calls, an ``X-Role`` header is also accepted as an explicit credential, but only when
``auth.allow_role_header`` is enabled (config.toml) — turn it off in production so a
real session is the only way in. ``current_principal`` resolves the caller (401 if it
cannot); ``require()`` is a FastAPI dependency factory that returns 403 when the
resolved role lacks a permission.
