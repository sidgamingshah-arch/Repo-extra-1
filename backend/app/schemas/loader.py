"""Load & validate template + ontology definitions.

The key cross-check: every ``canonical_key`` referenced by the ontology (in mappings
and decomposition rules) must resolve against the template, and every rollup/identity
must reference node_ids that exist. This is enforced on upload so a bad
template/ontology pairing is rejected with a clear list of offending keys.

A second check applies on UPLOAD ONLY: a key the schema does not declare is reported
(:func:`unknown_keys`) instead of being silently dropped. See that function for why the
strictness cannot live on the models themselves.

A ``schema_version: 2`` ontology also carries a SECTION LAYER — properties authored once per
section in ``section_defaults`` and claimed by a concept through ``inherits``.
:func:`resolve_inherits` folds it in, and it runs BEFORE validation: see that function for why
it cannot be a model validator.

    Deliberately NOT a pydantic validator, for two reasons. Once validated, a concept that
    inherited ``match_priority`` is indistinguishable from one that declared it and from one that
    declared nothing at all (the model's default filled the field), so "declared wins" can only be
    decided on the raw dict — and the same is true of every optional field the section layer
    touches. And resolving before validation means the RESOLVED shape is what gets validated, so
    a section default with a bad value fails at the door rather than reaching a concept.

    Without this fold the section layer is inert: ``section_scope``, ``statement``,

    publishes, reports success, and simply does not contain the thing that was authored. The
    author's next clue is an extraction that behaves as though the edit was never made.

    This is deliberately NOT ``model_config = ConfigDict(extra='forbid')`` on the models. The same
    two loaders read every definition already stored in the database, and those call sites do not
    all expect failure: ``languages.py`` has no handler at all (a 500), ``templates.py`` swallows
    the error and serves a silently emptied ontology, and the extraction worker swallows it into
    ``template = None``, which marks the run SUCCEEDED with every structural check quietly gone.
    Rejecting an undeclared key belongs at the door, where there is a request to fail and a person
    to tell; on the read path it would turn one bad row into an outage.
