"""Ontology schema — rules that describe how to recognise each canonical line item
from arbitrary source descriptions, fix signs, find note refs, and decompose notes.

The ontology is *data, not code*: editable from the frontend, versioned, and
hot-swappable per job. Aliases/keyword/regex hints are **locale-scoped**
(``*_i18n``) so the same ontology drives extraction across the supported languages,
and ``number_format_by_locale`` makes number parsing locale-correct (a wrong
decimal/thousands separator silently corrupts values).

``schema_version: 2`` rulebooks add a SECTION LAYER: the properties that are true of every
concept printed under one section banner (which statement it is on, its ``section_scope``,
instant-vs-duration, the expected sign, the default match priority) are authored once in
``section_defaults`` and claimed by a concept through ``inherits``. Nothing in this module
performs that fold — a concept's own declaration must win over the inherited value, which is a
statement about the RAW definition, not about validated defaults (a pydantic default is
indistinguishable from an authored one). :func:`app.schemas.loader.resolve_inherits` does it
before validation; the fields exist here so the resolved shape validates and so a v1 rulebook,
which has no section layer at all, keeps loading unchanged.
