"""Publish only the notes the face statements actually point to.

A filing's notes section covers far more than the statements: accounting policies, segment
commentary, governance tables, subsequent events. Only the notes a face line REFERENCES
explain a published figure, and those are the only ones this product is asked to deliver —
an unreferenced note is noise in the notes index, the export and the review queue.

Runs after reconciliation on purpose: the note→face subtraction checks need every note that
was extracted, so pruning earlier would weaken the reconciliation that decides which figures
are trustworthy. Pruning here means one filter governs every consumer of ``doc.notes``
(extraction result, notes index, Excel export) rather than each re-deriving the rule.

Nothing is deleted from the source document or from provenance — this only decides what is
PUBLISHED, and the log records exactly what was dropped so a missing note is explainable.
