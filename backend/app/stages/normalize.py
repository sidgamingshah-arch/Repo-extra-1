"""Sign & unit normalization stage — and what the rulebook expects the fact to be.

Produces the sign-normalized ``ExtractedValue.value`` from the printed ``value_raw`` using
signals the printed magnitude alone doesn't carry:

* ``Less:`` / ``Add:`` label cues — a line prefixed "Less:" is a deduction (negative);
  "Add:" is an addition (positive).
* the ontology's ``sign_rule.flip_if_label_matches`` regexes for the mapped concept — the
  ontology author's targeted sign corrections.

The printed-sign tier (parentheses / trailing minus) is already decoded into ``value_raw``
by ``services.numbers`` at extraction; this stage layers the label-driven corrections on top.
Values with no applicable cue keep ``value == value_raw``.

WHERE PARENTHESES ARE DECIDED, and why the global switch is reported rather than honoured.
``parse_number`` reads the LOCALE's ``number_format.negative`` (``["paren", "minus"]``), which is
the live switch and the right altitude for it: parentheses-as-negative is a convention of how a
filing is printed. ``global_rules.paren_means_negative`` is a second copy of the same switch that
the parser never sees, and it cannot be honoured after the fact — only the signed magnitude
survives extraction, so nothing downstream could tell "(600)" from "-600" in order to undo one
and not the other. The duplicate switch that pretended otherwise has been removed from
``GlobalRules``: parentheses are decided by ``number_format_by_locale`` alone, at the one point
where the printed text is still in hand.

Once a value is normalised, two v2 declarations say what the resulting FACT is supposed to look
like, and both are checked here because this is the stage that finishes the number:

* ``sign_convention`` (``positive_expected`` / ``negative_expected`` / ``either``) is an
  EXPECTATION, not a transformation — the rulebook says so in as many words: "a concept whose
  sign_convention is positive_expected or negative_expected but whose loaded value carries the
  opposite sign is a review trigger, not an auto-correction". So a figure arriving with the wrong
  sign is flagged and its sign confidence drops; the value is left exactly as reported.
  ``sign_rule`` keeps doing the normalising — the two are different jobs on purpose, since a
  concept can legitimately want a targeted flip AND an expected sign.

  ONE EXCEPTION, and the rulebook states it as a separate rule beside that one:
  ``sign_convention.unsigned_source`` — "where a filing prints expenses as unsigned positives in a
  by-nature list, negate on load and set sign_normalised: true on the fact so the transformation is
  auditable". That is a different claim about a different thing. The expectation sentence is about
  ONE row disagreeing with its siblings, which is a mis-mapping and must not be papered over by a
  flip. This one is about a whole statement's expenses being printed without signs, which is a house
  style with no row to suspect — and leaving it alone is not neutral, because the template's
  subtotals are signed sums (``pl_gross_profit = sum(revenue, cost_of_goods_sold)``), so every
  subtotal on such a filing comes out wrong and every ratio built on one with it.
  ``_negate_unsigned_expenses`` implements it, and the test that separates the two cases is
  unanimity across the statement — see that method and ``_UNSIGNED_COHORT_MIN``.

* ``temporality`` (instant / duration) and ``unit_of_account`` (balance / flow / subtotal) say
  whether the concept is a position at a date or a movement over a period. The balance-sheet
  non-controlling-interests BALANCE and the profit-attribution FLOW share their caption exactly,
  and the filing prints them in different statements; a caption match alone will happily file the
  P&L figure on the balance sheet, where it is individually plausible and every subtotal still
  ties. The two are different facts, so the figure is NOT merged into the concept: the row keeps
  its value and provenance and loses the concept, which puts it in the review queue instead of on
  the balance sheet. The statement each temporality belongs to is read from the rulebook too — an
  ontology that declares its balance-sheet sections ``duration`` gets no such finding.
