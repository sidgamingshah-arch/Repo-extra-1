"""Row/value extraction stage.

Reconstructs tables and turns their rows into ``LineItem``s in one step, per source:

* Excel — values + exact cell provenance read straight from the workbook.
* Native PDF — the PyMuPDF text layer feeds the shared ``row_reconstruct`` logic
  (locale-aware value parsing via ``services.numbers``, two-level
  Consolidated/Standalone header detection, note-ref capture, bbox provenance).
* Scanned PDF / image — the OCR port produces words that feed the same reconstruction.

Notes pages route to note-detail tables; every other in-scope page yields face line items.

Every source is read by the rulebook the RUN was pinned to (:func:`reconstruction_rules`), which
is what this stage threads into reconstruction.

    Those two blocks decide which printed COLUMN each figure is taken from — which column is the
    Group's, which one is the current period, what scale the numbers are in — so they have to come
    from the rulebook the run is labelled with. Reconstruction used to read them from the rulebook
    shipped as the one in force instead (``row_reconstruct.in_force_rules``), which meant a run
    pinned to rulebook A had its pages read by rulebook B's rules: the pin decided how the figures
    were MAPPED and not how they were READ, and pinning an older rulebook to reproduce an earlier
    spread silently produced neither rulebook's answer.
