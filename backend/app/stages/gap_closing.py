"""Gap-closing stage — ask the model where a leftover line belongs when a subtotal won't tie.

Runs after mapping and residual routing (so it only sees lines those two genuinely could not
place) and before the structural checks (so a subtotal the routing fixes reports as tied rather
than as a defect the analyst has to chase).

The decision is the provider's; the arithmetic only decides what it is allowed to choose from.
With no provider configured the stage does nothing at all — see services.gap_closing.
