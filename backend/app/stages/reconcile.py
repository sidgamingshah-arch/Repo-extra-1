"""Reconciliation stage (§20) — applies the note→face subtraction.

For each face line that cites a note, per (basis, period), it subtracts the note detail lines
that are *themselves* ingested as distinct template lines (avoiding double counting), writes
the reconciled figure onto the face ``ExtractedValue.reconciled`` (always derived from the raw
face value, so re-running is idempotent), and records a ``ReconciliationEntry``.

It also grades how well the note total ties back to the face figure. Three things make that
grading non-obvious, and getting them wrong floods the review queue with non-findings:

* **A cited note is usually not a breakdown of the face figure.** "Profit before tax" lists
  selected items charged and credited; a segment note analyses by division; a commitments note
  is a schedule. None of them sum to the face line. Only a genuine decomposition ties, so a
  residual far from the face figure is graded ``unconfirmed`` rather than asserted as a
  mismatch — see ``services.reconcile``.
* **One note number can span several tables** (continuation pages, sub-analyses). Emitting one
  entry per table multiplies the same question. Exactly one entry per
  (face line, note, basis, period) is recorded, using whichever table corroborates best.
* **Not every extracted column is a reported period.** A third or fourth numeric column
  (maturity dates, coupon rates, an entity column) is not comparable to a face figure, so only
  the reported periods take part in the tie.

The arithmetic core lives in ``services.reconcile`` (pure, unit-tested); this stage wires it
to the document model.
