"""Structural validation stage — runs the declared arithmetic over the mapped line items.

Wires ``services.structural_checks`` (pure, unit-tested) to the document model: it stores the
report on ``doc.structural`` and flags every line item and value that participates in a failed
relation, so a mis-mapped or mis-signed number reaches the review queue even though its label
matched perfectly.

The rulebook's ``validation`` block is passed in with the template, so the run also evaluates the
rulebook's own identities, its cross-concept guards and its section reconciliation. Three
consequences differ here, and they differ because the rulebook says they do:

* a ``blocking`` break caps the value's validation confidence — the figure cannot be right;
* a ``warning`` break is flagged but does not cap. ``global_rules.sign_convention`` states it
  outright ("a review trigger, not an auto-correction"), and capping on warnings would hold every
  filing with a classification difference below the auto-accept threshold;
* a failed section reconciliation blocks AUTO-APPROVAL of that section, which is enforced the only
  way the pipeline can enforce it: every value in the section is capped below the auto-accept
  confidence, so no figure in an unreconciled section is ever accepted without a reviewer.

It runs after the confidence stage on purpose: that stage assigns ``validation`` outright for
the balance identity, while a structural failure may only *lower* an existing signal — so it
has to see the final value, not be overwritten by it.
