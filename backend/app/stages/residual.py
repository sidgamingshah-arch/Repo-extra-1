"""Residual routing — a printed face line never disappears, on the terms the rulebook sets.

A statement is a complete document: every line the filing prints on the face of the balance
sheet, income statement or cash flow statement contributes to that section's subtotal, and the
subtotal to the statement's total. So an extracted face line that matched no specific concept
cannot simply be dropped — doing that silently removes real money from the statement and the
subtotals stop tying. It belongs in its own section's residual bucket ("Others"), which is what
that bucket is for.

Placing a line in the right section is the whole problem, and the statement's own structure
answers it: **a section runs up to its subtotal**. "Trade and bills payables" through to "Total
current liabilities" are the current liabilities; whatever is printed between the previous
subtotal and the next one belongs to the next one's section. That works where banners do not —
the income statement prints no section banners at all, and a cash flow continuation page often
shows only a truncated running header.

Three signals are used, strongest first:

1. the section banner above the row, when it names a section we know (``section_hint``);
2. the next section subtotal at a higher ordinal — the accounting structure above;
3. the section of the nearest preceding mapped line, for a trailing row after the last subtotal.

WHO DECIDES THE TERMS. With a ``schema_version: 2`` rulebook loaded, none of the sweep's terms are
this module's opinion: ``residual_framework`` states when the sweep runs, which rows it may take,
what a component must record, the identity the section must then satisfy, and the six conditions
that send a section to review — and each of those is read here (:func:`_read_terms`,
:class:`_Residual`, :func:`_reconcile`). A per-concept ``residual_policy`` overrides the framework
for one residual (``population``, ``cross_section``, ``notes_as_source``, ``plug``, ``itemise``),
and ``never_sweep`` names what that residual must never absorb however similar the wording. Editing
any of those in the ontology changes what this stage does; that is the point of authoring them.

Two terms are declarations the engine refuses rather than implements. ``plug_behaviour: forbidden``
and ``derivation: forbidden`` say a residual is never computed as (reported subtotal − mapped
children): a plug hides a missed row inside a plausible number, while a sum of components leaves the
loss visible as an ``unallocated_gap`` the reconciliation reports. So a residual whose own policy
asks to be plugged is a contradiction in the rulebook, and it is reported as one instead of being
honoured.

THE FIVE PROHIBITIONS are read the same way (:func:`_read_prohibitions`), and each one switches on
the guard named beside it in ``_PROHIBITIONS``: delete the sentence from the rulebook and the guard
goes with it. They are not restatements of the sweep's per-row terms — every one of them catches a
residual holding a figure the sweep never took, which is the failure a section subtotal cannot show.

WHAT IS PROSE HERE, and deliberately left as prose. ``sweep.candidate_set``, ``itemisation.rule``
and ``reconciliation.identity`` each state in one sentence what several read terms already do, so
driving the engine from the sentence would only add a second, weaker copy of a live switch:

* ``candidate_set`` ("every printed value row on the FACE … whose resolved section equals the
  residual's single section_scope value") is the population built from ``population``,
  ``eligibility`` 1-4 and ``notes_as_source``, all read below. Its one independent clause — a
  SINGLE section_scope — is enforced, under prohibition 5, because a residual scoped to two
  sections has no candidate set at all.
* ``itemisation.rule`` is ``aggregation: sum_of_components`` (read) plus the promise that a swept
  row keeps its own label and sign, which :func:`_component` does by construction.
* ``reconciliation.identity`` is the equation :func:`_reconcile` evaluates through
  ``rollups.reconcile_section``; the terms that can vary — ``tolerance``, ``on_failure``,
  ``sections_without_reported_subtotal`` — are all read.

Those three sentences are held by ``tests/test_residual_framework.py``:
``test_the_reconciliation_identity_and_the_candidate_set_are_performed_as_written`` is the reference
they point at, alongside the itemisation and aggregation tests beside it.

Rows deliberately NOT routed: anything that is itself a subtotal or total (it would be counted
twice), a section header, an attribution caption, a per-share figure, a narrative sentence, a
note-reference-only row, and rows with no value at all — the eligibility list the framework prints,
each entry with its own test here. A row whose SECTION cannot be resolved is not swept either: it
goes to review, because guessing a section is exactly the cross-section rescue the block forbids.

Whether the routing is *correct* is not a matter of opinion: once residuals are in place, each
section subtotal must equal the sum of its children. The framework's reconciliation identity checks
that here, per column, and the structural stage checks the template's rollups again later — so a
mistake shows up as a reported gap rather than as a plausible-looking number.

Without a v2 rulebook (a v1 ontology, or none at all) the template-driven routing below is used
unchanged: the template's ``__others`` keys, the same three signals, no itemisation to record.
