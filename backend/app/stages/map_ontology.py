"""Ontology-mapping stage — applies the multi-strategy matching ensemble.

Wires each extracted ``LineItem`` through ``services.mapping.OntologyMatcher`` and
records the winning canonical key, method, and per-strategy confidence. The ontology
+ locale come from the extraction job; adapters (embedding/LLM) are pulled from the
registry when configured.

Two things happen here that the matcher cannot do, because they are judgements about the WHOLE
document rather than about one caption:

* **batching** — the unit handed to ``match_batch`` is one (statement, basis, period), so a
  statement printed across two pages is decided whole (:func:`batch_groups`).
* **containment and equivalence** — a gross parent may not be filed alongside the children it
  contains (``is_gross_parent`` / ``children_if_decomposed``, and the same rule stated globally in
  ``global_rules.mutually_exclusive_groups``), and two captions the rulebook declares to be one fact
  (``equivalence``) may not disagree in silence. Both are only decidable once every row has a
  concept, so they run as a pass over the mapped document.

    The unit is **(statement, basis, period)**, not the source page it used to be. Grouping by page
    decided a statement that spans two pages in two calls, so no cross-line judgement could span the
    break — and a page break is exactly where a filing is most likely to cut a section in half,
    leaving a subtotal in one call and the lines it is made of in the other.

    Basis and period belong in the key because they are what identify WHICH statement: an annual
    report prints the consolidated balance sheet and the company balance sheet under the same
    classifier verdict, in different column blocks. Merged, the model would be shown each caption
    twice and asked to map both rows to one concept.

    They are read PER PAGE — the union of the columns that page's rows carry — and not per row,
    because the columns are a property of the page's header bands. Per row, any line that happens to
    print no prior-period figure would be split off into a call of its own, which is the
    fragmentation this change exists to remove.

    Rows the classifier gave no statement for are grouped by PAGE (the fallback key) and returned
    with ``None`` as the statement, which the caller maps per line. A group with no statement is not
    what a batch is for: it gets no statement-scoped candidate list, so the whole ontology would be
