"""Closing a subtotal gap by routing leftover lines into a section's Others.

The face carries the COMPUTED figure for every calculated line (see services.rollups). When that
differs from the figure the document printed, the most common cause is not bad arithmetic — it is
a line the mapper could not place. The filing's subtotal includes it; our computation does not.

At the same time the extraction usually holds a handful of lines that reached no face statement at
all — captions the mapper found no concept for, or found a concept for that no statement carries.
This module asks whether any of those, dropped into the section's residual "Others" bucket, would
account for exactly the difference.

Two things decide it, and both must agree:

* **Arithmetic** proposes. Only a subset of leftovers whose figures close the gap in BOTH periods
  within tolerance is even offered — one period is a coincidence waiting to happen, two is
  evidence. This bounds the search and makes a wrong answer arithmetically visible.
* **The model disposes.** Whether "Pledged bank deposits" belongs under current assets is a
  question about meaning, not about numbers, and a subset that happens to add up is not a reason
  to move a line into a section it does not belong to. The provider picks one of the offered
  subsets, or none.

With no provider configured nothing is routed: the gap stays a review item, which is the honest
outcome rather than a guess dressed as a reconciliation.
