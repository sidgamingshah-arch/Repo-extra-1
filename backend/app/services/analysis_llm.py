"""LLM-backed financial analysis — the structured schema, prompt, and runner used by
the ``POST /projects/{id}/analysis`` endpoint.

Feeds the project's extracted line items to the configured LLM provider (Anthropic or
any OpenAI-compatible gateway — see app/adapters) and asks for canonical mappings plus
ratios and a one-page commentary, validated against :class:`Result`. Returns the parsed
result together with the provider's token-usage meta so the run can be written to the
audit log. Mirrors scripts/live_analysis.py, but as an importable service the API uses.
