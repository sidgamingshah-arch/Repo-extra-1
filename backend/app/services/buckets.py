"""Segment a filing's extracted source into the eight buckets an analyst reads it in.

THE TAXONOMY IS MIXED ON PURPOSE, because that is how a balance sheet and an income statement are
actually read: five of the buckets are BALANCE SHEET SECTIONS, two are WHOLE STATEMENTS, and one is
the remainder. So the resolver asks two questions in order — which statement, then which section —
rather than one.

WHY IT CANNOT RUN STRAIGHT AFTER PAGE CLASSIFICATION. Classification answers "which statement is
printed on this page". A balance sheet prints four or five of these buckets on ONE page, so the
page's statement can never separate them: only a row's own section can, and a row's section is
known once reconstruction has read its banner and mapping has resolved its concept. The segmentation
therefore runs at the END of the pipeline, over the finished document.

THE SECTION → BUCKET EDGE IS DERIVED, NOT TABULATED. A template's section ids carry the section
phrase (``bs_s2_current_assets``), and that phrase is already the codebase's section vocabulary —
``mapping.HEADING_ROW_SECTIONS`` holds the same eight tokens the extractor recognises as printed
banners. So the ordinal prefix is stripped and the remainder is looked up in that vocabulary, which
means a rulebook and this layer cannot drift into two different ideas of what "current assets" is.
A balance-sheet section whose token is NOT in the vocabulary is reported in ``unknown_sections``
rather than quietly counted as Others.

WHAT LANDS IN OTHERS, and the distinction the store keeps:

* the balance sheet's own totals (``bs_top_level``: total assets, total liabilities and equity).
  These are not in any one section — they span them — so no section bucket can hold them without
  being wrong. Deliberate, and not a failure.
* the statement of changes in equity, which is the EQUITY bucket rather than Others: it is that
  section's movement, and an analyst asking for equity wants it.
* a row nothing could place. Also Others, but recorded in ``unresolved_face_item_ids``, because
  that one IS a coverage failure and must not be indistinguishable from the first.
