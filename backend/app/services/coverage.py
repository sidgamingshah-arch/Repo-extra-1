"""The coverage contract for structural validation — how much of the declared structure a run
actually verified, stated so it cannot be mistaken for how much of it passed.

``structural_checks`` emits one row per declared relation with ``pass`` / ``fail`` / ``skipped``
and no denominator. Read naively that is a trap: a statement with 3 passes and 11 skips reports
three passes and no failures, and every consumer that divides passes by *checked* relations calls
it 100%. The eleven relations nobody could run are exactly the ones that would have caught the
mis-mapping.

So this module reports TWO numbers and refuses to reduce them to one:

* ``validation_rate`` = pass / evaluated — of the relations that ran, how many held;
* ``coverage_rate``   = evaluated / declarable — how many of the relations that this filing MAKES
  ANSWERABLE ran at all.

Neither is meaningful alone and neither is ever emitted alone (:meth:`CoverageReport.as_dict`
carries both or neither). ``pass / (pass + fail)`` is not offered under any name: it equals the
validation rate, and every use of it as "the" score is the collapse this module exists to prevent.

``declarable`` counts the relations declared for the statements PRESENT in the filing — not the
relations that ran. That is what makes the coverage rate fall when extraction is thin: a relation
skipped because its inputs were never extracted stays in the denominator, because better
extraction would recover it. The skip taxonomy is where that judgement is recorded, and the split
between its first two buckets is the whole point:

* ``INPUT_ABSENT`` — recoverable. A row was not extracted, two participants disagreed on scale,
  a guard's precondition was not met. Belongs in an improvement backlog.
* ``TAUTOLOGICAL`` — NOT recoverable, however good extraction gets. An input to the relation was
  derived from the relation, so it cannot fail. No amount of extraction quality turns it into a
  check; the relation has to be re-authored or the derivation removed.
* ``NO_REPORTED_SUBTOTAL`` — the filing (or the template) prints no subtotal to reconcile against.
* ``UNEVALUABLE_RULE`` — the rule as authored cannot be run at all: an unparsable expression, a
  term naming nothing, an op with no semantics, a guard sentence matching no predicate. It counts
  in the denominator (it was declared for a statement that is present) but it is not an extraction
  problem and never becomes one, so folding it into ``INPUT_ABSENT`` would put an authoring defect
  into the extraction backlog and quietly keep it there.
* ``STATEMENT_ABSENT`` — the only bucket that does NOT count. A standalone-only filing has no cash
  flow statement; holding it against the run's coverage would make every filing look incomplete.

Three alarm states are reported explicitly, because each of them is invisible in the counts:

* a statement whose every declarable relation was skipped is ``UNVALIDATED`` — it has no failures
  and it has proved nothing, and it must never render as "passed";
* more ``TAUTOLOGICAL`` skips than evaluated relations means the validation layer is mostly
  checking its own arithmetic;
* a guard whose precondition is ``"always"`` coming back skipped cannot be a fact about the
  filing — it is a defect in this pipeline, and it is labelled one.
