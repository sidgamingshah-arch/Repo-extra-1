"""How an extracted row's values are read — which column is which period, and what figure a
concept actually shows.

Every consumer of an extracted row (the statement view, the Excel export, the note tables, the
accounting checks) has to answer the same two questions, and answering them differently is how a
prior-year figure ends up printed under the current year, or how a validated total stops being
the total on screen. So the answers live here, once.

Extraction labels a value's column as it reads it: ``current`` for the leftmost figure column,
``prior`` for the next, ``colN`` beyond that, and — for a matrix statement such as changes in
equity — the column's own printed heading ("Retained profits"). A row that carries no figure at
all in the current year therefore has values labelled ``prior`` and nothing else, which is
exactly the case the naive "first value is the current one" fallback gets wrong.

    company-only — one ``company_only_markers`` hit is enough to label a whole page — rendered an
    empty default tab with its figures one tab away, and the analyst has no reason to go looking.

    A DOCUMENT THAT LABELLED ONE BASIS DREW NO DISTINCTION. It printed one set of figures and the
    extractor described the only column there was; that is not a division of the statement into two.
    Asked for the consolidated view, the one set of figures is the answer.

    ONLY TOWARDS CONSOLIDATED, and the asymmetry is the point. Consolidated is the default view and
    the reading a filing gets when nothing says otherwise (``row_reconstruct._basis_for`` returns it
    when no basis band is found at all). Standalone is never a default: clicking it asks for the
    COMPANY's figures specifically, and answering with the Group's would be a wrong number. That
    request keeps its existing named refusal — ``basis_not_extracted``, which the grid states rather
    than showing a blank — and this function must not take it away.
