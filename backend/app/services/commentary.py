"""Financial-analysis commentary — a one-pager derived from the extracted context.

Computes standard ratios from the extracted statements and selects strengths /
weaknesses from a fixed, localizable catalog by threshold — so the commentary is
genuinely data-driven (not free-form prose) and every emitted string exists in the
i18n table (``i18n_data.TR``) for translation. It is an automated analytical summary,
not investment advice; it also surfaces that figures are provisional while review
