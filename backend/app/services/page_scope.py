"""Page-scope counts, derived from the page cards they sit above.

The header sentence ("Focused 8 of 84 pages · 76 pages skipped") and the filter chips are the
SAME fact as the grid of cards underneath, so they are counted here, once, from the cards. Two
routes serve that screen — the real document and the sample project — and the sample route did not
count at all: ``focused: 14, total: 84, skipped: 70`` were literals sitting over ten page cards,
so the screen read "Focused 8 of 84" with eight of ten cards in scope, and an "All 84" chip beside
ten. The filter chips were worse than wrong: the client maps them POSITIONALLY to page kinds
(all / face / notes / other), and the sample route served six differently-ordered labels, so
clicking one filtered by a kind it did not name.

Deriving both from ``cards`` makes the arithmetic unarguable, and makes the invariant that already
covers the real route (``total == len(pages)``) cover the sample one too.
