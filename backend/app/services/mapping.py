"""Ontology mapping — a combination of methods, with the LLM as the key driver.

Mapping a printed source line to a canonical template concept is done by **meaning**,
not string similarity — but as an *ensemble*: every method contributes and they
corroborate one another. No single methodology is forced out.

1. exact / normalized lexical  (free, unambiguous → short-circuits)
2. rule-based                  (regex / keyword hints, minus exclude hints)
3. similarity / fuzzy          (rapidfuzz — candidate evidence + shortlist)
4. semantic embeddings         (cosine similarity — candidate evidence + shortlist)
5. **LLM semantic decision**   (the key driver): shown each candidate's criteria
   (definition, include/exclude, confusable-with, value_scope) plus the ontology's global
   policies + worked examples, it chooses by meaning — so "Amounts due from customers",
   "Receivables from clients" and "Trade debtors" all resolve to ``trade_receivables``
   with no lexical alias hit.

Combination policy: exact wins outright; otherwise the LLM decides but is corroborated by
the deterministic methods — agreement raises confidence, a strong lexical disagreement
lowers it and flags review (the agreeing methods are recorded). When no LLM is configured
(``extraction.llm_mapping=false`` or provider ``stub``) or it abstains, the deterministic
ensemble decides with a margin-over-runner-up accept. Each value also carries an
``allocation_status`` so parent/child/residual handling stays auditable. Winning method,
confidence and per-strategy scores are recorded.

    :func:`section_of_banner` matches a section phrase ANYWHERE in the text, which is right where
    geometry has already established that the text is a standalone heading — a printed line with no
    figures beside it, on a statement face. It is wrong where there is no geometry to lean on.

    A spreadsheet row is the case in point. "Label column has text, value columns are empty" is a
    banner sometimes and a line item with no data for either period the rest of the time, and
    substring matching cannot tell them apart: "Equity investments designated at FVOCI" contains
    "equity" and would scope every row beneath it — a non-current asset declaring the equity section.
    "Total current assets" contains "current assets" and is the LAST row of its section, so reading
    it as a banner scopes the NEXT one.

    The same distinction bites on a PAGE, which is why ``row_reconstruct._is_banner_line`` reads
    through here too. A caption wrapping over two printed lines puts "Equity investments designated"
    on a line of its own, and substring matching took that for the equity banner — truncating the
    item to "at FVOCI" and scoping every row below to equity while it is a non-current asset.
    Exhaustion refuses it, because "equity" does not account for "investments designated".

    Callers whose evidence is weaker than a printed label-only line add ``HEADING_ROW_SECTIONS`` on
    top of this; the function itself does not, so the page path still recognises a profit-and-loss
    banner ("Other comprehensive income") that a data-less spreadsheet row is not trusted to declare.

    So this requires the label to be EXHAUSTED by section phrases. One phrase ("Current assets"), or
    several where a filing puts both languages in one cell ("Current assets 流動資產"), and nothing
    else. Anything left over means the label says something the section vocabulary does not cover,
    which makes it a caption.

# Concepts that a statement prints under ONE caption and that differ only in which section

# it: the answer is corrected to the sibling the banner names instead of being discarded. Discarding
# it drops the row to a weaker path, and for the P&L bottom line that loses the largest figure on
# the statement — a wrapped bilingual "TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE / LOSS FOR THE YEAR" reaches the matcher
# as the bare fragment "LOSS FOR THE YEAR", which is an alias of the OTHER bottom line.
#
# These are declared here and not read out of the rulebook, which is a compromise worth naming.
# The v2 ontology describes every one of these collisions — `section_disambiguation` prose on 18
# concepts, and `binding.order` step 6 nominating mutual `confusable_with` as the tie set — but
# neither is usable as the declaration:
#   * `confusable_with` is a confusion graph, not a family. Its mutual pairs connect into a single
#     47-concept component in the shipped file (share capital → reserves → NCI → the tax lines →
#     both bottom lines), so re-routing anywhere inside it would move an answer between concepts
#     that are different facts — the opposite of conservative.
#   * `section_disambiguation` is free-form prose, and only some of it names the sibling's key at
#     all. Scraping keys out of it would make a wording edit a behaviour change, and prose cannot
#     be told apart from "never confuse this with that", which means the opposite.
# A typed family block on the schema is the right home; see the integrator note. Until it exists,
# a rulebook that does not contain these keys simply has no families and nothing re-routes.

        LineItems. Falls back to per-line matching for anything the batch call can't resolve, or
        entirely when no LLM is configured.

        The batch is ONE STATEMENT — the caller groups by (statement, basis, period) and no longer
        by source page (``stages.map_ontology``), so a statement printed across two pages is decided
        whole. That is what the judgements above need: a subtotal and the lines it is made of, or a
        section and its residual, routinely straddle the page break.

        Large statements are CHUNKED at ``BATCH_MAX_ITEMS`` rather than sent as one unbounded call,
        each chunk with its own derived response budget (:meth:`_batch_max_tokens`). Chunks are
        contiguous slices of print order, so a chunk boundary is the only place cross-line context
        is lost, instead of every page boundary.

        ``items`` is a list of (item_id, source_label). ``sections`` maps an item_id to the
        section banner that item was printed under; a batch spans several sections, so the banner
        is per item, not per batch.

        The banner is given to the MODEL as well as being enforced after it answers. It used to
        be enforcement only: the model decided blind to the banner and a cross-section answer was
        then discarded, dropping the row to the weaker per-line path. Withholding the one piece of
        context the answer is graded on is how a caption that only its banner can disambiguate
        ("Others", the two "Non-controlling interests" of a comprehensive-income statement) got
        decided wrong and then thrown away.

        A refused answer inside a declared collision family (``CONCEPT_FAMILIES``) is now RE-ROUTED
        rather than discarded, because the banner already says which sibling was meant. Every other
        refusal — wrong statement, the concept's own exclusions, a caption naming a mutually
        exclusive class — still stands and is still counted as ``batch_refused``."""
