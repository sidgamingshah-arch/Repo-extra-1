"""Runtime-mutable settings overlay.

Most settings come from ``config.toml`` / env and change only on redeploy. A few are
meant to be flipped live by an admin from the Settings screen:

  * ``ui_localization``  — localize the whole interface.
  * ``review_required``  — require a reviewer step (else the workflow closes at analyst).
  * the LLM configuration — provider / model / base_url / temperature / max_tokens /
    timeout / api_key_env. Edits are applied onto the process-wide ``Settings.llm`` so
    the provider registry and adapters pick them up immediately. The **API key is never
    stored here** — only the *name* of the env var it is read from.
  * the EXTRACTION thresholds — the mapping ensemble's accept/candidate/margin bars and the
    reconciliation tolerances (see ``EXTRACTION_KNOBS``). Applied onto the process-wide
    ``Settings.extraction``, which the pipeline reads per run, so a change takes effect on the
    next extraction and never rewrites one that already happened.

Every change is PERSISTED to ``setting_overrides`` and re-applied at startup, so an admin's
edit survives a restart and is shared by every process against the same database. The
config file remains the source of the DEFAULTS — "restore defaults" means what config.toml
shipped, never the last value that happened to be stored.

The in-memory copies are a read-through cache of that table: reads never touch the database,
writes go to both. Two processes changing DIFFERENT settings do not interfere (one row per
setting); two changing the SAME one are last-write-wins, and the losing process keeps its own
value until it restarts or is told again — acceptable for an admin screen, and the reason the
table stores one row per setting rather than a single blob.

**No secrets are persisted.** The LLM API key is never written: only the NAME of the
environment variable it is read from.
