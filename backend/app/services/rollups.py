"""Computing the template's calculated lines, and the rulebook's section arithmetic.

A template marks each line `extracted` (read off the document) or `calculated` — a subtotal,
a total, a net figure — declared with a `rollup {op, children}` naming exactly which lines feed
it. This module evaluates those declarations.

A v2 ontology states the same kind of arithmetic from the other side: not "this node is the sum of
those nodes" but "this SECTION must account for every row printed under it"
(``residual_framework.reconciliation``). :func:`section_members` and :func:`reconcile_section`
evaluate that identity, and they live here rather than in the residual stage so there is one module
that knows how a total is built from its parts — the two must not disagree about what counts as a
contributor.

Why the computed figure is the one that gets shown: a subtotal read off the page is a fourth
opinion, alongside the lines it is meant to be the sum of. When they disagree, showing the
printed one puts a number on the face that its own components contradict, and every total above
it inherits the contradiction. Showing the computed one makes the spread internally consistent by
construction — and turns the disagreement into a finding, which is what the review queue is for.

The printed figure is never discarded. It is what the divergence is measured against.

Evaluation is dependency-ordered because rollups nest: a statement total rolls up section
subtotals which roll up their own lines. A cycle (a template that declares A from B and B from A)
is reported rather than recursed into.
