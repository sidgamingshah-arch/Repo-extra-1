"""Identity for a human judgement on a review finding — content-derived, never id-derived.

A reviewer who examines a finding and records that the figures stand is making a claim about
WHAT was on the card, not about where that card happened to sit in a list. Two of the eight
review-check builders key their ``id`` on the ROW INDEX of the extracted line
(``chk-unmapped-{i}`` and ``chk-lowconf-{i}``, api/routes/documents.py:715 and :729), and a row
index moves whenever extraction composition changes — one more line reconstructed, one fewer
heading suppressed, a different page order. An id-keyed acceptance would then silently land on a
DIFFERENT line item after a re-run, marking a real problem as vouched for by a named person who
never saw it. That is strictly worse than having no acceptance mechanism at all, so identity here
is the sha256 of the finding's canonicalized SUBJECT — the semantic thing being judged — and
never the check id.

The second hash, over the finding's EVIDENCE, is what makes an acceptance withdraw itself when
the figures move: the same subject carrying different numbers is a different claim, and it is
reported as ``stale`` rather than quietly kept. The digest is recomputed here from the stored
evidence on every read; it is deliberately NOT a column on the table, because a derived value
persisted beside its source is the two-places-computing-one-quantity bug.

This is the ONLY module in the codebase that hashes, and it is pure: no DB, no FastAPI, and no
translation. Localized strings arrive as already-bound callables from the route that owns the
review vocabulary, which is also what keeps ``subject_key`` and ``evidence_digest`` byte-identical
in all four locales — identity must not depend on who is looking.

    """Attach each finding's judgement state, and report the judgements nothing matches.

    ``rows`` is the list of IN-FORCE accepted judgement rows as plain dicts
    (``subject_key``, ``subject``, ``evidence``, ``reason``, ``actor``, ``actor_role``, ``at``,
    ``run_id``). Every check in ``checks`` is mutated in place with ``status``, ``judgement``,
    ``ambiguous``, ``ambiguous_count``, ``conflict``, ``conflict_count``, ``conflict_note`` and
    ``judgement_withheld``.

    TWO FINDINGS SHARING ONE SUBJECT ARE NOT ONE CASE. The subject is built to discriminate (a
    content-derived source anchor, api/routes/documents.py::_prov_anchor), but no scheme can
    promise it always will, so the two possible outcomes are distinguished here rather than
    conflated:

    * same subject_key AND the same evidence_digest — the findings are indistinguishable in
      every respect the card showed, so one judgement legitimately covers all of them. That is
      ``ambiguous``, and the caption "accepting one accepts them all" is true;
    * same subject_key and DIFFERING evidence_digest — the identity scheme FAILED. These are
      demonstrably different claims (different figures were printed) that identity cannot tell
      apart. Attributing a stored judgement to any of them would put a named reviewer's verdict,
      reason and timestamp on figures they never saw, which the module docstring calls strictly
      worse than having no acceptance mechanism at all. So no judgement is attached to ANY card
      in such a group, the group is served as ``conflict``, and the endpoint refuses acceptance
      on that subject. An honest refusal is the correct product behaviour; a fabricated
      attribution is not.

    A withheld judgement is NOT reported as orphaned: the finding it was made on is still being
    raised, so "this judgement's finding is no longer raised" would be a second false statement.
    It is flagged on the cards as ``judgement_withheld`` instead.

    The four localized strings this needs are supplied bound: ``label_fn(subject)`` names an
    orphaned judgement's subject in prose, ``rows_fn(subject, evidence)`` renders the judged
    figures as ``[label, value]`` pairs — the same two-column shape as a check's ``calc``, so the
    client reuses one renderer and formats no figure itself — ``changed_fn(subject, keys)`` names
    the quantities that moved, and ``conflict_fn(subject, count, withheld)`` says plainly that the
    queue cannot tell these findings apart. Keeping the translation outside this module is what
    makes the two digests locale-independent.
