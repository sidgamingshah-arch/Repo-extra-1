"""Structural validation — the arithmetic the template and the rulebook declare, used to catch
mis-mapped values.

A label matcher can only ever be wrong about *which* concept a number belongs to, and no
amount of string evidence exposes that. Arithmetic does: if ``Gross profit != Revenue − Cost
of sales``, or a subtotal misses the sum of its declared children, then a value sits on the
wrong line or carries the wrong sign. This module evaluates four families of relation, none of
them hardcoded here:

* the TEMPLATE's ``rollup`` on subtotal/total nodes and its statement-level ``identities``;
* the RULEBOOK's ``validation.identities`` — one authored ``expr`` per relation, each with its
  own ``severity``, evaluated exactly as written (see ``ontology_identities``);
* the RULEBOOK's ``validation.cross_concept_guards`` — pairs that are individually plausible and
  jointly wrong, which no arithmetic can reach (see ``cross_concept_guards``);
* the RULEBOOK's ``validation.section_reconciliation`` — every section with a reported subtotal
  must account for its printed rows (see ``section_relations``).

Two rules keep it honest on partial extractions (the normal case for a 270-page filing):

* A relation is evaluated only when the total AND every declared component was actually
  extracted and mapped for that (basis, period) — *unless* the relation sums a statement
  section that owns a residual bucket. There, an absent child is genuinely nil and is taken as
  zero, so the relation is checked rather than skipped. The difference is completeness: once
  every printed line in a section is routed either to a specific concept or to that section's
  "Others" (see ``stages.residual``), a child that is still absent is a line the filing does
  not print — and a line a filing omits is zero, not unknown. Without that guarantee the same
  assumption would fail nearly every subtotal, which is why it is gated on the bucket existing
  rather than applied everywhere. Keys taken as zero are listed in ``assumed_zero`` on the
  result, so a pass is never mistaken for full extraction.
* No value is derived, defaulted or back-filled to make a relation balance. A concept mapped
  twice with conflicting values is likewise refused rather than resolved by picking one.

Sums are signed, so the arithmetic holds whichever way the filing states expenses (a cost of
sales printed in parentheses arrives negative and simply adds). When a relation fails, the same
signed arithmetic can say whether flipping exactly one participant's sign would satisfy it —
reported as ``sign_suspect``, because a mis-signed value is a different fix from a mis-mapped
one. It is a hypothesis attached to the finding, never an adjustment.

EVERY relation produces a row, including the ones that could not be run, and each skip carries a
``reason`` a caller can classify (:mod:`app.services.coverage`). That is what stops "3 relations
passed" from reading as "the statement is validated". A relation the RULEBOOK authored so that it
can never run is not a skip at all — it is reported with the distinct ``error`` status, see
``AUTHORING_REASONS``.
