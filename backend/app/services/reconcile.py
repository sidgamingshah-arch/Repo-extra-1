"""Note→face reconciliation (Requirement 20) — the highest-value logic.

When a detailed item comes from a NOTE and the FACE has an overarching line that
references that note, the face aggregate must be adjusted by **subtracting** the note
detail(s) that are *also* ingested as their own template lines, so nothing is
double-counted and totals tie.

This module implements the arithmetic as pure functions (no I/O) so it is exhaustively
unit- and property-testable. The stage wraps it.

Key invariants:
* Reconciliation is computed **from the raw face value**, never from an already
  reconciled figure → re-running is idempotent.
* Signs are respected: a detail that is itself negative is subtracted with its sign.
* Values must share a unit context before subtraction (caller converts to base units).
