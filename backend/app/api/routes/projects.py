    The REVIEW_SUBMIT permission is only granted to the analyst while the review step
    is enabled (see security.effective_permissions), so this 403s once review is off.

    ``document_id`` NAMES WHAT IS BEING SUBMITTED, and it is the whole point of this signature.
    The Export screen serves an uploaded document and the seeded sample from the same controls, but
    this route hardcoded ``DEMO["project"]["entity"]`` — so submitting a real filing wrote an audit
    entry naming the demo company. An audit trail whose entries name the wrong entity is worse than
    no audit trail: it reads as a submission that happened, for a company nobody submitted.

    The entity comes from the run's own ``result["entity"]`` — the name the extraction read off the
    filing — never re-derived here. A document with no run, or a run that has not named an entity,
    is REFUSED (422) rather than falling back to the demo name: "I do not know whose filing this is"
    is the true answer, and the fallback is exactly the defect.

    Recorded under ``project_id`` regardless, because the audit log is keyed by project and the
    Audit view reads that one key; the entry says which entity and which run it is about.
