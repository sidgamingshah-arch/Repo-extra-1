"""The shipped template + rulebook must reach a RUNNING app, not only a fresh one.

``ensure_reference_data`` used to write a version 1 when no version of the key existed and never
look at the files again, so every revision made after a database's first startup was invisible to
the app using that database. The suite could not see it: ``conftest.py`` points
``FINEX_DATABASE_URL`` at a fresh temp database, so pytest always seeded the current file. The
reader's symptom was "Gross Profit and the other calculated totals still render at the END of the
template" — true of the definition the app was serving, which was the pre-revision profit-and-loss
with every calculated total bunched at the bottom.

Every test here builds its OWN database from ``Base.metadata`` and calls the function directly. Not
the session-scoped ``client`` fixture, for two reasons: this is a test about what happens on the
SECOND boot against an existing database, which the shared fixture (seeded once, at startup) cannot
express; and publishing rival rulebook versions into the shared database would change which rulebook
every later test file finds in force.
