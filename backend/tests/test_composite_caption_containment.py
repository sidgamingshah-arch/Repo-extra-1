"""The reviewer's composite-caption netting rules, as the engine actually reads them.

Fourteen rules arrived written against ``gross_parent_candidates`` / ``dedicated_children`` /
``double_count_control`` — a vocabulary nothing in this codebase reads, and one ``NettingRule``
rejects outright because it requires ``target_key``. They were translated into the live containment
pair (``is_gross_parent`` + ``children_if_decomposed``), which ``map_ontology._pairs_to_keep_apart``
already enforces. See ``scripts/apply_netting_v2.py`` for the translation and for the four rules
that landed thinner than written.

These tests hold the translation in place. The one that matters most is
``test_a_composite_caption_is_not_an_alias_of_the_narrow_leaf``: before this change, a filing
printing "Trade and other receivables" bound the whole combined amount to
``bs_current_assets__trade_receivables``, because that composite caption was an alias of the narrow
leaf. Put the alias back and that test fails — which is the point of it.
