"""Resolving a row-shaped review finding by re-mapping it to a different template line.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES, reported by the user: "there is no way to resolve for review items — I should
be able to map it against a different line item." Both row-shaped cards already PROMISED it in
prose — the unmapped card's fix reads "Pick the correct template line item", the low-confidence
card's "Confirm the concept is correct or reassign it" — and the only write the screen offered was
the sign flip. A card telling the analyst to do something the product cannot do is worse than a card
that says nothing.

The properties that matter are the refusals, because the failure mode is silent: the card the
analyst was reading disappears whether the concept landed on their row or on a different one.

* an ambiguous row reference is REFUSED, never resolved to the first match;
* a target the run's template does not offer is refused, and so is a CALCULATED subtotal —
  writing a printed figure onto one produces a rollup that contradicts itself;
* the decision is RECORDED on the row (from, to, who, when, why) and the row's method and
  confidence move with it, so the finding it answered does not come back on the next fetch.
