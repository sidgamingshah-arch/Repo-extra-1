"""NO LINE THE TEMPLATE DOES NOT DEFINE MAY REACH A STATEMENT.

Reported by the user as two symptoms of one defect: "recheck whether any line item can be added to
the template and where — there should be no additions", and "Gross Profit and the other calculated
totals still render at the END of the template on the front end despite the positioning the spec
fixed".

They were the same hole. The statement grid emitted the template's skeleton and then appended an
"Other extracted items" section holding every row whose canonical_key carried the statement's prefix
but was not one of the template's declared children — the in-statement successor of the
Additional-items view that had already been removed for exactly this reason. That both ADDED lines
the template does not define, and (for a run pinned to a superseded template, which every run is
pinned to something) put the very lines whose position a template revision had corrected back at the
end of the spread.

Removing the bucket cannot make a real extracted figure disappear, so the four properties are pinned
together here:

* the template's skeleton is the WHOLE statement, in the template's order — ``pl_gross_profit`` sits
  where the template puts it and not after everything;
* a mapped row the template does not declare reaches NO row of the grid;
* …and is reported as exactly one ``off_template`` review finding, carrying the ``remap`` offer that
  resolves it — so the figure is visible and actionable rather than merely gone;
* a matrix statement (changes in equity), whose rows are movements rather than template lines, is
  REFUSED outright when the run's template declares no such statement;
* and the statement says whether its shape came from a template version that has since been
  superseded, which is the other way a corrected line order still renders wrong.
