"""A bilingual caption reads as two phrases, and one activity is never another.

A filing that sets English and Chinese side by side in the label column lets the pair wrap
together, so merging the printed lines splices the languages into each other. Regrouping by script
fixes the caption — and, on the real filing, immediately created a second problem worth pinning
here: with each language contiguous, two cash-flow subtotal captions that differ by ONE word in
seven scored 0.92 against each other and the financing figure was filed under investing. Both
behaviours are tested together because the second only exists as a consequence of the first.
