"""``binding.order`` — the rulebook's declared precedence, as the engine actually runs it.

The v2 rulebook authors the binding order as eight numbered steps and the engine used to implement
about half of them. The load-bearing gap was step 3: "Restrict the candidate concept set to concepts
whose section_scope contains the resolved section." The full statement was offered to every tier and
to the model, and a cross-section answer was refused AFTER it came back — which spends the call,
drops the row to the weaker per-line path, and grades the model against a constraint it was never
given a candidate list under.

Covered here, one section per step:

* step 3 — the candidate set is narrowed BEFORE any matching or any LLM call
* step 4 — the rule tier runs in descending ``match_priority``, ``exclude_hints`` a hard veto
* step 5 — the semantic tier only ever sees the restricted set
* step 6 — a tie between mutually-``confusable_with`` concepts is resolved by
  ``section_disambiguation`` or emitted for review, never picked by declaration order

plus the batching the order presumes: one call per (statement, basis, period), chunked with a
response budget measured from the response envelope.
