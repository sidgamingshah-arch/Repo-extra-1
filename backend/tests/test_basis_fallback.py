"""A statement whose rows carry one basis is served for either basis, and says which it served.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. ``basis_values`` filters a row's values to the requested basis, so a
statement whose rows were all labelled one way returned NOTHING when the other was asked for. The
Workspace opens on Consolidated, so a filing extracted as company-only rendered an empty grid with
its figures one tab away — and an empty grid is indistinguishable from a statement the filing does
not contain. The endpoint's own comment described this as intended ("empty if the source didn't
present that basis"), which is why it survived.

WHAT IS NOT DONE, and the reason: the single basis is served under ITS OWN name, not relabelled
consolidated. A filing that prints only the Company's balance sheet is a company-only statement, and
captioning those figures Consolidated would state something false about a real number — the same
mistake ``company_only_markers`` exists in ``row_reconstruct`` to prevent, arrived at from the
display side. A document that identified no basis at all is already tagged consolidated at
extraction (``_basis_for`` returns it when no band is found), so that case needs nothing here.
