"""The coverage contract, re-verified end to end rather than on hand-written rows.

:mod:`app.services.coverage` exists to stop "3 relations passed" reading as "the statement is
validated", and the only way to know it still does is to run a real filing through the worker and
hold the stored result to the contract:

* THREE buckets, always all three, and they total the rows — nothing quietly leaves the arithmetic;
* both rates or neither, and no third number anywhere: ``pass / (pass + fail)`` IS the validation
  rate, and offering it alone under any name is the collapse this module prevents;
* the skip taxonomy applied to every unrun row, with the absent-statement bucket the only one
  outside the denominator;
* the alarm states firing on the conditions they name — a statement that proved nothing, and a
  guard that promised to answer unconditionally and did not.

The real-run assertions are deliberately shape-based, not thresholds: extraction quality moves, and
a contract test that fails because the mapper got better is a test nobody trusts. The alarm states
are then forced deterministically against the same shipped template and rulebook, because an alarm
that has never been seen to fire is not evidence of anything.
