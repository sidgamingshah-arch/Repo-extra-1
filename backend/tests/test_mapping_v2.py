"""The mapper OBEYS the v2 rulebook's control fields.

Three behaviours, each of which the schema declares and the matcher previously ignored:

* **the residual lock** — 13 concepts carry ``alias_matching: "disabled"``, ``match_priority: 0``
  and ``value_scope: "exclusive_residual"``. They are the section "Others" buckets: the section's
  parent minus its confirmed children, populated by the sweep and by nothing else. Reachable by
  matching they are the most attractive concepts in the file — "Others" is short enough to fuzz
  against anything, and a model offered a bucket will use it for a row it cannot place. Either way
  the figure lands in what is supposed to be the section's UNEXPLAINED remainder, and the
  reconciliation that would have reported the gap ties instead.
* **match_priority** — an ordering, so the long specific concept is read before the short generic
  one it collides with on token overlap. Not a score: it may not outrank evidence.
* **family resolution** — a decision that is right about what kind of thing a row is and wrong only
  about which section variant is corrected by the banner, not thrown away.
