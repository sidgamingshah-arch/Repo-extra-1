"""The v2.1 rulebook: it must load with NOTHING dropped, and its section layer must resolve.

Two failure modes are covered here. The first is the one ``unknown_keys`` exists for: a block the
schema does not declare is ignored by pydantic, so the rulebook publishes and simply is not the
rulebook that was authored. The second is subtler and cannot be seen from the file at all —
``section_scope``, ``statement``, ``temporality`` and ``face_only`` are authored on ZERO concepts,
only in ``section_defaults``, so without the ``inherits`` fold every concept loads with no section
at all and the section-first binding order the rulebook specifies has nothing to bind against.

    against — uploaded by an admin, or published by correcting a concept from the Template screen.

    THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, and this file previously asserted its opposite. ``select_for_template``
    had grown five ranking tests: drop declared supersessions, prefer the shipped key, prefer a
    rulebook that declares a supersession, prefer the incumbent key, then highest version. Each was
    added to work around the one before it, and together they meant a rulebook stored AFTER the
    shipped one did not take over — so publishing a corrected 185-concept rulebook beside an obsolete
    173-concept one changed nothing, and the product went on mapping filings with a rulebook whose
    tax bucket the specification had removed. This test used to REQUIRE that, under the name "does
    not displace the incumbent".

    Uploaded under a key that sorts EARLIER than the shipped one, so no sort order can be mistaken
    for the mechanism: it wins on recency alone.
