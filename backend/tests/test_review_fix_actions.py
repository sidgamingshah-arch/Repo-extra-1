"""Which findings offer a mechanical fix, and what happens after one is applied.

"Apply fix" could never be honest for every check: a balance-identity mismatch has two sides and
the arithmetic cannot say which is wrong, while a sign anomaly names exactly one figure. So exactly
one check type carries a ``fix_action`` — a structural relation whose ``sign_suspect`` resolves to a
single contributing, unedited, non-zero, non-calculated row — and every other type carries ``null``
with prose instead of a control that either does nothing or invents an answer.

The other half of the honesty is what the card does AFTER the fix: ``run.result["structural"]`` is
written once by the pipeline and nothing recomputes it on an edit, so the relation is not
re-evaluated until the next extraction and the card does NOT disappear. That is asserted here
explicitly, because a card that survives its own fix looks like a button that did nothing unless it
says why.
