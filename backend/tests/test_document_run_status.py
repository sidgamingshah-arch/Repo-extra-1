"""Per-document run status: is this document being extracted RIGHT NOW?

WHAT WAS MISSING, MEASURED. Nothing in the API answered "does this document have an extraction in
flight?". ``GET /documents/{id}/run`` refuses until a run has a RESULT
(``documents.py::get_document_run`` — ``if run is None or not run.result: raise 404``), which is
precisely the state a running run is not in, and ``GET /extractions/{run_id}`` needs a run id that a
freshly loaded page does not have. So a screen opened mid-run had one fact available to it — a 404 —
and the only sentence it could write from that was "this document has not been extracted", while the
pipeline was working on it.

Both halves of the gap are measured here against the SAME document: the new read reports ``running``
for a run with no result while ``/run`` still 404s on it, and it reports ``none`` — a 200 — for a
document nobody has ever extracted. Re-introduce the defect by putting
``if run is None or not run.result: raise 404`` back into ``get_document_run_status`` and both of
those tests fail; the ownership tests fail if its ``authorized_document`` dependency is dropped.

HOW THESE TESTS SEE A RUNNING RUN. Under ``TestClient`` a FastAPI BackgroundTask finishes inside the
POST, so no poll can catch one in flight (``test_extraction_progress`` documents the same
constraint). A run row in exactly the state the pipeline leaves mid-run — ``status="running"``,
``result=None``, a full progress record — is therefore written directly, and removed again: the
suite shares one database, so a hand-written run left behind is a run every later test that
enumerates them has to know about.
