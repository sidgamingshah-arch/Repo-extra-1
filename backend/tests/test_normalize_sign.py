"""``sign_convention`` is an expectation, and ``temporality``/``unit_of_account`` are an identity.

Three declarations meet in the normalize stage, and they are easy to confuse with each other:

* ``sign_rule`` NORMALISES — "Less:" makes a figure negative, and the ontology author's
  ``flip_if_label_matches`` regexes correct a specific caption. It changes values, and it keeps
  doing so.
* ``sign_convention`` EXPECTS — the rulebook's own words: "a concept whose sign_convention is
  positive_expected or negative_expected but whose loaded value carries the opposite sign is a
  review trigger, not an auto-correction". Silently flipping such a figure would hide the reason it
  arrived wrong (almost always: the row is on the wrong concept) behind a plausible number, while
  the template's subtotal identities quietly stopped meaning anything.
* ``temporality`` + ``unit_of_account`` IDENTIFY the fact — a position at a date or a movement over
  a period. The balance-sheet non-controlling-interests BALANCE and the P&L attribution FLOW share
  their caption word for word, so nothing in the caption stops the period flow being filed on the
  balance sheet, where it is individually plausible and every subtotal still ties. They are
  different facts and must never merge.
