"""``sole_component_of``: a subtotal printed ALONE collapses onto the child the rulebook names.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, reported off a real HKEX filing: the income statement prints one
undifferentiated tax line — "Income tax credit/(expenses) 3,159" — and splits current from deferred
nowhere. Total tax expense was filed and both template children stayed empty, so the analyst had a
total with nothing under it and no way to tell whether the split was missing or genuinely absent.

The inference divides nothing: the whole figure IS the current charge. That is the entire reason it
does not collide with ``global_rules.no_fabricated_split``, and it is why the refusals below matter
more than the acceptance — the moment a deferred amount is evidenced anywhere the filing has a split,
and asserting the whole charge is current would publish a figure the page contradicts.

Every test edits the rulebook or the page and watches the extraction change. Deleting
``sole_component_of`` from the concept turns the whole pass off, which is what makes the field a
declaration rather than a comment.
