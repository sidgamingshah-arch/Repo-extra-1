    The route had no ``ORDER BY``, so rows came back in insertion order — oldest first — and every
    client picked a template with ``find(x => x.template_key === key)``, which is the FIRST row with
    that key. So three screens named v1 as the active template however many revisions existed, and the
    extraction view resolved a run's ``template_version_id`` the same way: a re-extraction ran against
    the OLDEST template and could not produce a revised statement order. Selecting was worse than
    ineffective — every row in the picker carried the same key, so choosing v2 stored the key already
    held and the list re-answered v1.

    Versions are inserted OUT of order here (2, then 4, then 1) so insertion order cannot be mistaken
    for the ordering under test.
