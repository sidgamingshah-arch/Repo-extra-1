"""A printed face line always reaches the face, and always in the period it was printed in.

Two independent failures both silently removed real money from a statement:

* a line that matched no specific concept was dropped, so the section subtotal stopped tying;
* a line reporting only ONE of the two comparative periods had that figure filed as "current"
  because it was the first value in its row, regardless of which column it sat under.

Neither is visible by reading a row — only the section subtotal reveals them, which is why the
structural rollups matter as much as the routing.
