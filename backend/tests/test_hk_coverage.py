"""Coverage and disambiguation for the HK/China (HKFRS) template + ontology, driven by the
captions a real HKEX property-developer filing actually prints (China SCE Group Holdings
AR2023, bilingual, Traditional Chinese).

Two distinct properties are pinned here:

* COVERAGE — a caption that is extracted and reconstructed correctly must not die because the
  template holds no such concept. Every caption below mapped to nothing before these concepts
  were added, so each assertion is a real gap that stays closed.
* DISAMBIGUATION — two concepts whose captions share most of their words must resolve to
  DIFFERENT keys. Both pairs below were confirmed mis-mappings caught by the structural layer
  as ``ambiguous_mapping`` (one canonical key holding two conflicting values), which is what
  happens when a caption lands on a neighbouring line of the same page.

The real ``OntologyMatcher`` is used, with the ``statement`` the caption was printed on, because
that constraint is part of the decision.
