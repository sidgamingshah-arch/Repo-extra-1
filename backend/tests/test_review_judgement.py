"""The review-item judgement layer: a finding can be ACCEPTED by a named person, and that
acceptance must never move onto a different finding.

The single most important test in this file is
``test_reordering_the_rows_does_not_move_an_acceptance_to_another_finding``. Two of the eight check
builders key their id on the row INDEX (``chk-unmapped-{i}``, ``chk-lowconf-{i}``), so an id-keyed
acceptance would silently follow the index onto whatever line item now sits there — marking a real
problem as vouched for by someone who never saw it, which is strictly worse than having no
acceptance mechanism at all. Identity is therefore the hash of the finding's SUBJECT, and this file
