"""The rulebook's ``validation`` block, and the coverage contract over its results.

Four things the rulebook declares are checked here, each of them by editing the rulebook and
watching the extraction's output change — a block that can be edited with no effect on the engine
is worse than one that says nothing, because the rulebook is the only place a reviewer can look up
what the pipeline is meant to do:

* ``validation.identities`` — 14 authored expressions, each with a severity;
* ``validation.cross_concept_guards`` — 6 pairs that are individually plausible and jointly wrong;
* ``validation.section_reconciliation`` — every section with a reported subtotal must account for
  its printed rows, and a break blocks auto-approval of that section;
* the coverage contract (:mod:`app.services.coverage`) — three buckets, two rates, a skip taxonomy
  and the alarm states, so a run that verified almost nothing cannot report as a clean one.
