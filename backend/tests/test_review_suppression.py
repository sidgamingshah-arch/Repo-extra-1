"""When one review card may stand in for another — pinned against the SHIPPED rulebook.

A card is left out of the queue only when a card above it ALREADY TELLS THE READER THE SAME THING:
the same difference, about the same target, in the same column. Anything less than that and the card
is served, because a duplicate is noise a reader can see past while a dropped card is a blocking
break reported nowhere at all — and the coverage band's "reported by a finding above" counter then
states that it WAS reported.

The suppression used to compare bare ``details.target`` strings, and on the equity section of the
shipped ``hkfrs_hk_china`` template that cost two blocking findings and a whole column:

* the template declares ``bs_equity__total_equity`` as a rollup subtotal AND the rulebook asks for
  its section to reconcile, so total equity is the target of TWO relations —
  ``rollup:bs_equity__total_equity`` and ``section_reconciliation:bs_s5_equity``. An equity-closing
  card whose target is that same key — asserting the break between the equity statement's closing row
  and the balance sheet — matched both by string and deleted them, whatever difference they found;
* the key carried no scope while ``chk-equity-closing`` is hardcoded consolidated/current, so that
  same consolidated card also deleted both relations in the STANDALONE column, which it makes no
  claim about at all.

Every relation test here is driven by the real loader, the real evaluator and the real review builder
over the shipped template + ontology, because the collision is the PRODUCER's: it is the template that
puts two relations on one target, and the rulebook that asks for the section reconciliation. A
hand-shaped relation dict cannot demonstrate either, and cannot notice a template revision moving
them. ``tests/test_review_checks.py`` holds the predicate-level tests over synthetic relations; this
file holds the payload a reader would have been served.

THE SAME BLINDNESS ALSO LIVED ON THE CALCULATED PATH, which asked one bare-key question — "does this
template line already have a card at all" — of two findings that say different things. The last three
tests are that half, and a dropped card there is worse still: a dropped relation is at least counted in
``failed_reported_elsewhere``, while nothing counts a calculated card at all, so it left the queue with
nothing anywhere saying it had. The balance card, hardcoded consolidated/current, deleted the standalone
column's printed-subtotal mismatch, and — reporting a 100 break of its own — deleted a 250 mismatch it
says nothing about in its own column.
