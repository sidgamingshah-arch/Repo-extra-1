"""``residual_framework``: one block governs all 13 residual concepts, and the engine obeys it.

Every test here edits the rulebook (or leaves it alone) and watches the extraction change, because
that is the only property worth having: a residual block that states a sweep policy the stage does
not execute is worse than no block at all — it is the one place a reviewer can look up what happens
to a row nobody claimed.

The failures being guarded are all failures of ARITHMETIC that nothing downstream can see:

* a plugged residual (reported subtotal − mapped children) makes every section tie by construction,
  so a row extraction missed is absorbed into a plausible number instead of reported as a gap;
* a subtotal caption the mapper failed to claim, swept into that section's Others, double-counts
  the whole section and the section still ties;
* a P&L attribution caption swept into the operating-expense residual merges a flow into a different
  section's arithmetic;
* a narrative sentence or a per-share figure in Others moves the subtotal by whatever it contained.

Three sentences in the block are PROSE and stay prose, because each states in one line what several
read terms already do — ``sweep.candidate_set``, ``itemisation.rule`` and
``reconciliation.identity``. The reference they point at is
``test_the_reconciliation_identity_and_the_candidate_set_are_performed_as_written``: it holds the
arithmetic and the population they describe, so the sentences document tested behaviour rather than
switch it.

    """Eligibility 5, and the number it exists to stop appearing on a statement.

    THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, measured off a real HKEX filing: a stale banner put cost of sales in the
    INCOME section, whose sign_convention is positive_expected, and an 814,645 COST swept into "Other
    income items". Total income came out at 32,097 against revenue of 868,375, and every total below
    it inherited the error.

    Review trigger 5 could not prevent it — that fires on the finished bucket, by which point the
    figure is in the statement and the analyst is reading it. A row whose sign contradicts the section
    it would be swept into is evidence the SECTION is wrong, not the amount, so it goes to review.
