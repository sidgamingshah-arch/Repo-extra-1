"""A worksheet gets a statement, so a spreadsheet is scoped like a page.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. ``ClassifyStage.run`` returned early for anything that is not a PDF, so
every worksheet kept ``statement=None`` from ingest. A statement is not decoration downstream, it is
a BOUNDARY:

* ``residual._section_of_row`` guards each of its structural signals with
  ``if statement and statement_of(nxt) not in (None, statement)``. With ``statement=None`` the guard
  is inert, so the walk runs past the end of the sheet it started on — a balance-sheet row could take
  its section from a cash-flow subtotal on a later sheet.
* ``residual._route_by_template`` is keyed by statement type outright, so it placed no Excel row at
  all.
* ``map_ontology.batch_groups`` had nothing to batch by, so every spreadsheet row was mapped with the
  whole ontology in front of it instead of one statement's concepts.

The title vocabulary is not duplicated for spreadsheets: ``statement_of_sheet`` feeds the sheet name
and the sheet's leading text cells through the same ``_title_candidates`` / ``_resolve_statement``
that a printed page's lines go through, so the strong/weak patterns, the negative filter, the
two-line join, the OCI collapse and the contents-page guard all apply unchanged.

The one deliberate difference is ``test_a_tab_name_does_not_need_the_english_anchor``.
