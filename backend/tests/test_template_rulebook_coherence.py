"""Two invariants the balance-sheet revision broke while the whole suite stayed green.

Neither restates a schema rule. ``validate_ontology_against_template`` checks that every CONCEPT key
resolves; nothing checked whether a rulebook's several statements of one concept's SECTION agree, and
nothing checked whether two declarations assert the same arithmetic.

Note what is deliberately NOT asserted here: that a rulebook's section ids equal the template's node
ids. They need not — ``mapping.section_token_of_scope`` reads the section name off the END of a scope
id, so ``bs_s3_current_liabilities`` and ``bs_s5_current_liabilities`` are one section to the gate,
and the shipped cash-flow sections are spelled differently in the two files today. Asserting equality
would be inventing a rule the code does not have.
