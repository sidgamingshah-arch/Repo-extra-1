// Frontend smoke regression. Boots the FastAPI backend + Vite dev server (which proxies
// /api → backend) and drives the real UI in the preinstalled Chromium. Serial + single
// worker because the "load sample" flow toggles process-wide backend state.

// THE SUITE'S OWN DATABASE AND OBJECT STORE — not the developer's.
//
// This config used to set only FINEX_EXTRACTION__LLM_MAPPING on the backend, so persistence fell
// through to the default `database_url = "sqlite:///./finex.db"`, resolved against `cwd: "../backend"`.
// The suite therefore ran against `backend/finex.db`, the file a dev server holds, and the damage was
// not theorised but found: that database held 18 ontology versions, 16 of them published by this
// suite, whose only difference from the seed was probe values this file's own tests type in ("E2E
// alias <epoch>", "E2E includes <epoch>", "E2E netting <epoch>"). Two separate faults in one:
//
//   * it MUTATED a developer's workspace — silently, on every run;
//   * and the suite's starting state drifted every time it ran, which is a first-order determinism
//     problem. "The rulebook in force" and "how many versions the index lists" are assertions in
//     here, and both were being answered by the residue of previous runs rather than by the seed.
//
// Absolute paths, derived from THIS FILE rather than from the shell's cwd: the backend runs with
// `cwd: "../backend"` and the runner may be invoked from anywhere, so a relative FINEX_DATABASE_URL
// would name a different file depending on who typed the command. Same env vars and same shape as
// backend/tests/conftest.py, which has always isolated the pytest suite this way.
