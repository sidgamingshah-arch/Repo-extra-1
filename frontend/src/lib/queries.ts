 *
 * It lives in the data layer because two screens ask the question (the index, to name the rulebook
 * a template row is described by; the extraction view, to decide which one a run defaults to) and
 * they were answering it differently: each had its own `version >` comparison, which is a third and
 * fourth spelling of a rule the server already owns.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Collapsing those two into one was right; the one was still wrong. It
 * ranked `[declares a supersession, version, ontology_key]` under a comment claiming it mirrored the
 * server's picker — a function that did not exist under that name, and whose actual rule is
 * "whatever was stored last wins" (`app/services/ontology_select.select_for_template`). That rule
 * turns on `created_at`, which this payload does not carry, so the client could not have applied it
 * even in principle. The two sides therefore named DIFFERENT rulebooks: the run mapped against the
 * one in force and the screen captioned it as pinned to an older one, telling an analyst their
 * extraction had used something it had not.
 *
 * So the server states it: `OntologyRef.in_force`, computed by asking `select_for_template` itself.
 * One implementation of the rule means there is nothing left to drift. Do not add a fallback
 * ranking here — a guess that disagrees with the extractor is exactly the defect above, and a row
 * whose payload predates the flag is better reported as "unknown" than named wrongly.
 *
 * `pred` narrows the candidates, normally to one target template, and the flag picks among them.
 * Where a caller cannot name a template — the extraction view and the Workspace both fall back to
 * an unfiltered call when no template is selected yet — several rows carry the flag, one per
 * template, and this returns the first in list order (the server orders by `ontology_key`, so it is
 * at least deterministic). That fallback names a rulebook for SOME template rather than the one
 * being read, which is the pre-existing weakness of asking without a template; it is not made worse
 * by reading the flag, and both callers use it only to have something to show before a template
 * is chosen.

/** Whether a document has an extraction IN FLIGHT — polled while it has one, and left alone the

 *
 *  This is the question a page loaded FRESH could not ask. `useExtraction`'s poll covers a run
 *  within one session because that session started it and holds its id; a hard reload has an empty
 *  cache and no run id, and `useDocumentRun` 404s until a run has a RESULT — so "being extracted
 *  right now" and "never extracted" arrived as the same answer, and a screen had to print the
 *  second. `status: "none"` is data here, not an error.
 *
 *  READ-ONLY, and that is load-bearing: the Workspace mounts this, and opening the Workspace must
 *  never POST a run just by being looked at. Nothing in this hook can start one.
 *
 *  NO `retry: false`, unlike the reads beside it. They decline retries because a 404 is one of their
 *  ordinary ANSWERS and repeating it is pure waste; here every answer is a 200, so an error is a
 *  genuine failure — and a transient one must not strand the caller, which it would: the interval
 *  below stops for anything that is not `running`, and with no data there is nothing for it to poll
 *  on, so one dropped request would leave a screen unable to say whether a run exists at all. */
