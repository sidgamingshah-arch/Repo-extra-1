/** Screen 5 — Review queue. Automated-check failures grouped by type; each expands into a
 * reconciliation breakdown, the suggested fix, and the judgement path.
 *
 * A finding could be corrected but never ACCEPTED: "Apply fix" and "Accept as is" had no onClick,
 * so a finding a reviewer had examined and deemed acceptable stayed red forever and nothing
 * separated "not looked at" from "reviewed and accepted". Both halves of that are now real, and
 * they are separate controls with separate gates:
 *
 *  - accepting/withdrawing records a JUDGEMENT (review:resolve) — a named person, a timestamp and
 *    a required reason, pinned to the FIGURES that were judged, so a re-run that moves them
 *    reopens the finding as `stale` rather than leaving a stale acceptance standing;
 *  - the flip-sign fix is an ORDINARY edit (extraction:edit), because it lands on the same PATCH
 *    the Workspace uses. Gating it on review:resolve — as it was — denied an analyst the one
 *    mechanical correction their role is entitled to.
 *
 * Only a mis-signed figure has a mechanical fix, and only when the server could resolve exactly
 * one row to flip. Every other card gets a sentence saying the fix is manual instead of a button
 * that would either do nothing or invent a mapping.
 *
 * THE ROW-SHAPED FINDINGS HAVE A THIRD CONTROL, and it is the one that RESOLVES them: re-map the
 * printed row onto a different template line (`RemapPanel`, extraction:edit — the same gate as the
 * flip, because moving a row is an extraction edit). Both cards' own prose had always instructed
 * the analyst to do exactly this — "Pick the correct template line item", "Confirm the concept is
 * correct or reassign it" — and there was nothing on the screen that could, which is a card telling
 * the reader to do something the product cannot do. The offer is per card (`check.remap`) while the
 * candidate list is served once per payload (`remap_targets`), and the accounting findings carry no
 * offer at all: a relation between several concepts gives no answer to WHICH one to re-map.
 *
 * A finding the server serves as `conflict` — its identity is shared with another finding that
 * printed DIFFERENT figures — gets no ACCEPT path at all: no Accept, no reason box, no stored
 * verdict shown, and a sentence saying the queue cannot tell the two apart. Attributing the one
 * stored judgement to whichever card the reader happened to open is how a reviewer's name ended up
 * against figures they never saw, so the refusal is stated rather than papered over.
 *
 * WITHDRAWAL IS NOT ACCEPTANCE, AND IS NOT GATED LIKE IT. Withdraw was gated on
 * `judgeable && canResolve && accepted`, using `accepted` as a proxy for "there is a stored
 * acceptance to take back". On a conflict card both `judgeable` and `accepted` are false, so a
 * WITHHELD judgement — one the server holds but will not attribute to any card — could not be
 * removed by anyone, while `withdraw_review_judgement` (documents.py) deliberately PERMITS
 * withdrawal there and its docstring calls it precisely the case a reviewer needs. The observed
 * consequence: accept a lone finding, let a second finding collide with its subject, and the
 * acceptance is frozen in place — one run later the surviving card is served `stale` carrying the
 * original actor, reason and figures, at rank 0, for a finding nobody examined. The same proxy hid
 * the control on a `stale` card too, where the row is equally withdrawable and re-accepting was
 * the only way out.
 *
 * So each control is gated on WHAT THE SERVER PERMITS, spelled from the payload:
 *  - Accept needs a subject AND a digest AND a non-conflicted, recognised state (the POST refuses
 *    all three otherwise) — plus a typed reason, because the POST refuses an empty one;
 *  - Withdraw needs only a stored in-force acceptance on this subject, which the payload states
 *    either as `judgement` (this card's own, accepted or stale) or as `judgement_withheld` (the
 *    conflict group's, unattributable). The DELETE takes the subject key alone, so nothing else
 *    may gate it.
 *
 * AND WITHDRAWAL IS REACHABLE WHEREVER AN IN-FORCE ROW IS SHOWN — not only on a card. The same
 * proxy that hid the control on conflict and stale cards hid it one row further along: an ORPHANED
 * judgement is an in-force acceptance (judgement.py::apply_judgements builds that list from the
 * verdict='accepted' rows, and DELETE /review/judgements/{subject_key} answers
 * 200 {'ok':true,'withdrawn':true} for it), it is rendered at the foot of this screen — and the
 * only withdraw control lived INSIDE a check card, so a finding with no card had a named,
 * standing acceptance nothing on the product could remove. Not cosmetic: the row keeps
 * verdict='accepted', so raising the same finding again with the same figures serves it
 * status='accepted' under a verdict nobody re-made. The orphan list now carries the control per
 * ROW, gated on the row existing (a subject key, and a document to address the DELETE to) and on
 * review:resolve — the endpoint's own two conditions — and says out loud that these acceptances
 * are still in force, because the caption "corrected, or no longer raised" reads as finished
 * with. */
